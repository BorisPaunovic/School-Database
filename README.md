# School Management System Database

Welcome to the School Management System Database repository! This repository contains the SQL scripts and database schema for implementing the database component of a school management system. The database is designed to store and manage various data related to students, teachers, courses, subjects, countries, and other aspects of school operations.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

- **Students:** Stores information about students, including their unique IDs, names, contact details, and other relevant details.
- **Teachers:** Contains information about teachers, such as their IDs, names, contact information, and other related data.
- **Courses:** Stores details about the courses offered by the school, including course IDs, names, descriptions, and other pertinent information.
- **Subjects:** Stores details about the individual subjects offered by the courses in school, including course IDs, names, descriptions, and other pertinent information.
- **Countries:** Stores the countries of students, along with other relevant data.
- **Users:** Stores information about Users of the website or app, including their unique IDs, names, contact details, and other relevant details.

And tables that connect two or more tables: StudentsCourses, CoursesSubjects, TeacherCourses.

## Setup

To set up the School Management System Database on your MS SQL Server, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your MS SQL Server using your preferred client or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Create a new database using the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SchoolManagementSystem;
```

Execute the SQL scripts in the scripts folder in the following order:  
- create_tables.sql: Creates the necessary tables in the database.
- create_indexes.sql: Creates indexes for optimized querying and performance.
- create_constraints.sql: Sets up the necessary constraints for data integrity.
- create_views.sql: Defines views for easier data retrieval and reporting.
- create_procedures.sql: Creates stored procedures for various database operations.
- create_triggers.sql: Defines triggers for enforcing business rules and automating actions.

The database is now set up and ready to be used by the School Management System application.

Or just restore the database from the .bak file.
